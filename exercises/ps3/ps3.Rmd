---

Prepare a write-up that includes your solutions to the following questions from
the course exercise sheet. Make sure to include all of your code and clearly
specify where each new problem begins. For problems that require you to
implement an interactive visualization, you may either (1) include a link to a
"live" version of the application or (2) include a link / attach screen
recordings of your interacting with the final visualization (in this case, make
sure to demonstrate all functionality).

**Coding**

* Glacial Lakes [3 points]
* Australian Pharmaceuticals II [3 points]
* Spotify Time Series II [3 points]
* CalFresh Enrollment II [4 points]

**Discussion**

* Temporal and Geospatial Commands [3 points]
* Visualization for Everyday Decisions [4 points]

### Grading Criteria

Each coding problem will be graded according to the following criteria,

* C1: _Attention to detail in visual design_. Your design choices should
demonstrate critical thinking around the appearance of graphical marks and the
queries that they support.
* C2: _Elegant code style_. The code you use to implement your visualizations
should be readable, modular, and concise. You may find it helpful to check your
code against the Tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
* C3: _Thoughtful explanations, interpretations, and organization_.
Your justifications should be complete, your interpretations should draw
creatively from relevant sources, and the submission overall should be
well-organized and formatted.

Discussion problems will be evaluated based on only the last.
