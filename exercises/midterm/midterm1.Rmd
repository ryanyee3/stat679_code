### Q1

Circle whether the following statements about interactive visualization with
Shiny are TRUE or FALSE.

  a. TRUE FALSE The `bs_theme()` function from the `bslib` library can be used
  to both customize the overall UI theme and modify fonts in a Shiny
  application.
  
  b. TRUE FALSE In order to implement a brush graphical query that only moves in the `x`
  direction, a version of the following code will have to appear at some point
  within the application's server function,
  
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
        plotOutput("output_id", brush = brushOpts("plot_brush", direction = "x")))
        ```
    
  c. TRUE FALSE By using a `reactive({...})` expression within a server function, it is
  possible to reduce the number of edges appearing in an application's reactive
  graph.
  
  d. TRUE FALSE If the code 
  
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
        output$scatterplot <- renderPlot({
          ggplot(filter(df, group %in% input$groups)) +
            geom_point(aes(x, y))
        })
        ```
  
     appeared in an application's server, then we would expect to see
     `plotOutput(input$scatterplot)` in the UI.
  
### Q2

Circle whether the following statements about interactive visualization with
Shiny are TRUE or FALSE.

  a. TRUE FALSE Imagine that we want to highlight a subset of circles that have
  been given the class name "highlighted." The code below could be used to
  increase the radius of all circles within this class to 5 pixels.
  
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
        d3.selectAll("#highlighted")
          .attr("r", 5)
        ```
    
  b. TRUE FALSE Imagine that `circle_data` is an array of objects giving x and y
  coordinates in fields called `x` and `y`. The code below will append one
  circle for each object in the array at the `x` and `y` pixel coordinates of
  the SVG.
  
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
        d3.data(circle_data).enter()
          .append("circle")
          .attrs({
            cx: d => d.x,
            cy: d => d.y,
            r: 5
          })
        ```
  
  c. TRUE FALSE Imagine that our visualization of the `circle_data` array currently
  displays 10 circles arranged from left to right. The code below will reduce
  the size of the three circles furthest to the right before completely removing
  their corresponding HTML tags from the page.
  
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
        circles = circles.slice(3)
        d3.select("svg")
          .selectAll("circle")
          .data(circle_data).exit()
          .transition()
          .duration(4000)
          .attr("r", 0)
          .remove()
        ```
  
  d. TRUE FALSE ID functions can be supplied to the second of argument a `.data()` call in
  order to associate each appended HTML element with a property appearing in the
  underlying array element.

### Q3

The example visualization below comes from the course notes. It is supposed to
help readers compare country populations.

```{r, out.width = 200, fig.align = "center"}
library(tidyverse)
gapminder <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/dyz0qohqvgake2ghm4ngupbltkzpqb7t.csv", col_types = cols()) %>% 
  mutate(cluster = as.factor(cluster))

print(head(gapminder, 3))
ggplot(filter(gapminder, year == 2000)) +
 geom_col(aes(country, pop))
```


  a. (2 points) Give two distinct examples of specific user queries related to
  the overall `gapminder` dataset printed above that are difficult (or
  impossible) to make with the current display.
      
      $$\\[2.5cm]$$
      
  b. (2 points) Sketch an alternative `ggplot2` implementation that addresses the issues
  you raised in part (a). Why does it help?
  
      $$\\[2.5cm]$$
  
### Q4

This problem asks you to share your conceptual and practical understanding of D3
scales.

  a. (2 points) In your own words, what purpose do D3 scales serve?
  
   $$\\[2.5cm]$$
  
  b. (2 points) The figure below visualizes miles per gallon vs. horsepower for
  a cars in an array called `cars`. Define a D3 scale that could be used to set
  the `x` coordinates of each circle on the SVG canvas. Assume that the SVG is
  600 pixels tall and 1000 pixels wide. For reference, each car's data object
  has a form like `{name: "chevrolet chevelle malibu", mpg: 18, horsepower: 130}`.
  
```{r, out.width = 250, fig.align = "left", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("figure/scatterplot.png")
```
  
  $$\\[1.5cm]$$
  
  c. (1 point) Imagine that the following `.attrs()` code was used to define the
  properties of each circle. Assuming your solution to (b), what code needs to
  be filled in to set the `cx` attribute?
  
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
        //[code defining the circles data bind]
        .attrs({
          cx: ... // fill this part in,
          stroke: "steelblue",
          fill: "none",
          ... [assume that all other attributes have been set]
   })
        ```
  
  $$\\[1.5cm]$$

### Q5

This problem asks you to share your understanding of the concept of graphical
queries in data visualization.

  a. (1 points) Provide a one sentence summary of the concept of graphical
  queries.

      $$\\[2.5cm]$$

  b. (2 points) Describe an example application that uses a graphical query.
  Give details of the interactivity patterns associated with your example. It is
  enough to provide an annotated sketch.
  
      $$\\[2.5cm]$$
    
    
  c. (2 point) Why is a graphical query appropriate in your example from part
  (b)? Contrast the graphical query approach with a non-graphical alternative.
  
      $$\\[2.5cm]$$


### Q6

The following code creates an interactive Shiny app that provides a histogram
that can be brushed to zoom into selected years in the California fires dataset.
A screenshot of the final visualization is shown below. Brushing over certain
years in the histogram highlights the corresponding fires in the dotplot.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = 400}
include_graphics("figure/fires.png")
```

  a. (2 points) The starter code below sets up the overall interface, but
  doesn't support brushing. Modify the UI so that years can be brushed as shown
  in the screenshot.
  
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  fluidRow(
    column(8, plotOutput("dotplot")),
    column(4, plotOutput("histogram"))
    ),
    dataTableOutput("table")
  )
         ```
         
      $$\\[1.5cm]$$
  
  b. (2 points) The starter code below sets up the server. Describe how to
  modify the code so that it updates both the dotplot and the table to reflect
  the currently brushed years. Be as specific as possible. The second argument
  of `dotplot` is a vector of `TRUE` or `FALSE` specifying whether a given row
  of fires should be highlighted. For reference, the function is given at the
  end of the exam.
  
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$dotplot <- renderPlot(dotplot(fires, # ??
  output$histogram <- renderPlot(year_histogram(fires))
  output$table <- renderDataTable( # ??
}
         ```
         
      $$\\[2cm]$$
  
  c. (2 points) Sketch the reactivity graph of your final application. Make sure
  to distinguish input, output, and reactive nodes.
  
      $$\\[5cm]$$
  
### Q7

In this problem, we will use D3's general update pattern to visualize a
two-dimensional random walk. The result is an animation of a square that is
moving in random directions across the screen and which leaves a "trail" of its
20 most recently visited positions. Four screenshots from one run of the program
are given below. The first two panels were taken within the first few timesteps,
which is why they show less than 20 squares.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "keep", out.width = 100}
include_graphics(c("figure/rw1.png", "figure/rw2.png", "figure/rw3.png", "figure/rw4.png"))
```

  You have been given the starter code below. `update_walk_data()` pushes an
  array element specifying the next location of the random walk. It also removes
  any array elements from more than 20 time units in the past. The `x` and `y`
  attributes within each element give the `x` and `y` coordinates of the walk.
  `timepoint` specifies the time step at which the array element was added. The
  definition of `update_walk_data()` is given at the end of this exam for
  reference.
  
```{r, eval = FALSE}
let walk = [{x: 250, y: 250, timepoint: 0}],
  timepoint = 0;

function update() {
  timepoint += 1;
  walk = update_walk_data(walk, timepoint)

  let rw = d3.select("svg")
    .selectAll("rect")
    .data(walk, d => d.timepoint)
}

d3.interval(update, 100)
```

  a. (2 points) How would you modify the `update()` function so that it removes
all "old" random walk locations that are no longer contained within the `walk`
array?

   $$\\[2.5cm]$$

  b. (2 points) How would you modify the `update()` function so that, after each
time step, it appends a rectangle at the newest random walk location?

   $$\\[2.5cm]$$

  c. (2 points) Notice that in the screenshots above, the random walk squares
become fainter the more time units they are into the past. How would you modify
the `update()` function to reflect this?

   $$\\[2.5cm]$$
