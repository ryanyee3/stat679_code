### Q1

Circle whether the following statements about interactive visualization with
Shiny are TRUE or FALSE.

  a. **TRUE** FALSE The `bs_theme()` function from the `bslib` library can be used
  to both customize the overall UI theme and modify fonts in a Shiny
  application.
  _The notes on `bslib` explain the use of this function for these customizations and more._
  
  b. TRUE **FALSE** In order to implement a brush graphical query that only moves in the `x`
  direction, a version of the following code will have to appear at some point
  within the application's server function,
  
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
        plotOutput("output_id", brush = brushOpts("plot_brush", direction = "x")))
        ```
  _This statement would have to appear in the UI, not the server._
    
  c. **TRUE** FALSE By using a `reactive({...})` expression within a server function, it is
  possible to reduce the number of edges appearing in an application's reactive
  graph.
  _By allowing several output elements to refer to the same intermediate reactive, the number of edges in the reactive graph will be reduced._
  
  d. TRUE **FALSE** If the code 
  
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
        output$scatterplot <- renderPlot({
          ggplot(filter(df, group %in% input$groups)) +
            geom_point(aes(x, y))
        })
        ```
  
     appeared in an application's server, then we would expect to see
     `plotOutput(input$scatterplot)` in the UI.
    _The syntax here is incorrect. We would expect to see a statement like `plotOutput("scatterplot")`._
  
### Q2

Circle whether the following statements about interactive visualization with
Shiny are TRUE or FALSE.

  a. TRUE **FALSE** Imagine that we want to highlight a subset of circles that have
  been given the class name "highlighted." The code below could be used to
  increase the radius of all circles within this class to 5 pixels.
  
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
        d3.selectAll("#highlighted")
          .attr("r", 5)
        ```
     _To select by class, we need to use the `.` syntax. For example,_
    
    
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
        d3.selectAll(".highlighted")
          .attr("r", 5)
        ```
    
  b. TRUE **FALSE** Imagine that `circle_data` is an array of objects giving x and y
  coordinates in fields called `x` and `y`. The code below will append one
  circle for each object in the array at the `x` and `y` pixel coordinates of
  the SVG.
  
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
        d3.data(circle_data).enter()
          .append("circle")
          .attrs({
            cx: d => d.x,
            cy: d => d.y,
            r: 5
          })
        ```
     _We need to create a D3 selection before we can bind the data. For example, we would use,_
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
        d3.select("#circles")
          .selectAll("circle")
          .data(circle_data).enter()
          .append("circle")
          .attrs({
            cx: d => d.x,
            cy: d => d.y,
            r: 5
          })
        ```
  
  c. **TRUE** FALSE Imagine that our visualization of the `circle_data` array currently
  displays 10 circles arranged from left to right. The code below will reduce
  the size of the three circles furthest to the right before completely removing
  their corresponding HTML tags from the page.
  
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
        circles = circles.slice(3)
        d3.select("svg")
          .selectAll("circle")
          .data(circle_data).exit()
          .transition()
          .duration(4000)
          .attr("r", 0)
          .remove()
        ```
     _This example comes from the week 5 - 3 [notes](https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat679_notes/2022/06/01/week5-1.html)_.
  
  d. **TRUE** FALSE ID functions can be supplied to the second of argument a `.data()` call in
  order to associate each appended HTML element with a property appearing in the
  underlying array element.

### Q3

The example visualization below comes from the course notes. It is supposed to
help readers compare country populations.

```{r, out.width = 200, fig.align = "center"}
library(tidyverse)
gapminder <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/dyz0qohqvgake2ghm4ngupbltkzpqb7t.csv", col_types = cols()) %>% 
  mutate(cluster = as.factor(cluster))

print(head(gapminder, 3))
ggplot(filter(gapminder, year == 2000)) +
 geom_col(aes(country, pop))
```

  a. (2 points) Give two distinct examples of specific user queries related to
  the overall `gapminder` dataset printed above that are difficult (or
  impossible) to make with the current display.
      
     We expected specific visual queries that are difficult to read -- it was not
    enough to give a general critiques. Here are examples of queries that you
    could have described,
    
     * For a given population range, which countries lie within it? This is difficult both because the country names are overlapping and because the countries are not sorted.
     * Related to the previous question -- which countries have the largest or smallest populations? 
     * How does population vary by continent? This is impossible, because we do not encode information about continents.
     * How has population changed over time? This is impossible, because we are only visualizing one timepoint.
    

  b. (2 points) Sketch an alternative `ggplot2` implementation that addresses the issues
  you raised in part (a). Why does it help?
 
     Suppose we wanted to make queries 1 and 3 above easier. We could rotate the plot to make the country names legible, sort by population size, and fill the bars in by continent.
  
     It is easier to make query 1 because the names are now legible. We also can look up all the countries within a range much more quickly, because they are placed closer to one another. Finally, since we encode continent group, we can see whether certain continents are overrepresented within certain ranges (we could have alternatively have applied faceting with a free `y` scale).

        ```{r, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 5, out.width = 300}
ggplot(filter(gapminder, year == 2000)) +
 geom_col(aes(pop, reorder(country, pop), fill = as.factor(cluster)))
        ```
    
### Q4

This problem asks you to share your conceptual and practical understanding of D3
scales.

  a. (2 points) In your own words, what purpose do D3 scales serve?
  
     D3 scales support visual encoding in D3, analogous to the `aes()` encodings in ggplot2. Specifically, scales map data attributes into SVG properties. For example, a color scale might map categorical groupings into an associated set of colors.
  
  b. (2 points) The figure below visualizes miles per gallon vs. horsepower for
  a cars in an array called `cars`. Define a D3 scale that could be used to set
  the `x` coordinates of each circle on the SVG canvas. Assume that the SVG is
  600 pixels tall and 1000 pixels wide. For reference, each car's data object
  has a form like `{name: "chevrolet chevelle malibu", mpg: 18, horsepower: 130}`.
  
     We can use a linear scale to map the continuous miles per gallon attribute
    into the 1000 pixels available for the `x` values. We could have mapped the
    `mpg` extent when computing the domain, but this was not required.

        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
        // solution 1
        let x_scale = d3.scaleLinear() 
          .domain([0, 50])
          .range([0, 1000])
          
        // solution 2
        let x_scale = d3.scaleLinear() 
          .domain(d3.extent(data.map(d => d.mpg)))
          .range([0, 1000])
        ```
    
```{r, out.width = 250, fig.align = "left", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("figure/scatterplot.png")
```
  
  c. (1 point) Imagine that the following `.attrs()` code was used to define the
  properties of each circle. Assuming your solution to (b), what code needs to
  be filled in to set the `cx` attribute?
  
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
        //[code defining the circles data bind]
        .attrs({
          cx: ... // fill this part in,
          stroke: "steelblue",
          fill: "none",
          ... [assume that all other attributes have been set]
   })
        ```
  
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
        //[code defining the circles data bind]
        .attrs({
          cx: d => x_scale(d.mpg),
          stroke: "steelblue",
          fill: "none",
          ... [assume that all other attributes have been set]
   })
        ```
  
### Q5

This problem asks you to share your understanding of the concept of graphical
queries in data visualization.

  a. (1 points) Provide a one sentence summary of the concept of graphical
  queries.
  
     Graphical queries are interactive visualizations where user queries can be
  defined visually, through brush, hover, or click events, for example.

  b. (2 points) Describe an example application that uses a graphical query.
  Give details of the interactivity patterns associated with your example. It is
  enough to provide an annotated sketch.
  
     We have had many examples of graphical queries in this course. For example,
  you could have sketched out the flights example from the Week 3 - 3
  [notes](https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat679_notes/2022/06/01/week3-3.html).
  You should specify that brushing any one histogram will generate a new
  histogram showing the distribution of variables after conditioning on flights
  lying within the current brushed region.
    
  c. (2 point) Why is a graphical query appropriate in your example from part
  (b)? Contrast the graphical query approach with a non-graphical alternative.
  
     Brushing is useful in this example because it removes the need for
    extraneous UI elements and allows us to focus on the data. A non-graphical
    approach to the same queries would require slider inputs for each input. The
    slider is not able to communicate information about the distribution for
    each variable, however. In general, we expected discussion about how
    graphical queries increase the information density of a visualization.

### Q6

The following code creates an interactive Shiny app that provides a histogram
that can be brushed to zoom into selected years in the California fires dataset.
A screenshot of the final visualization is shown below. Brushing over certain
years in the histogram highlights the corresponding fires in the dotplot.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = 400}
include_graphics("figure/fires.png")
```

  a. (2 points) The starter code below sets up the overall interface, but
  doesn't support brushing. Modify the UI so that years can be brushed as shown
  in the screenshot.
  
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  fluidRow(
    column(8, plotOutput("dotplot")),
    column(4, plotOutput("histogram"))
    ),
    dataTableOutput("table")
  )
         ```
         
     We need to modify the `plotOutput` element to support a brush input. We
     gave 1 point for realizing that the `brush` argument needs to be set. We
     gave 1 more point for correctly setting the `x` direction in `brushOpts`.
         
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  fluidRow(
    column(8, plotOutput("dotplot")),
    column(4, plotOutput("histogram", brush = brushOpts("plot_brush", direction = "x")))
    ),
    dataTableOutput("table")
  )
         ```
  
  b. (2 points) The starter code below sets up the server. Describe how to
  modify the code so that it updates both the dotplot and the table to reflect
  the currently brushed years. Be as specific as possible. The second argument
  of `dotplot` is a vector of `TRUE` or `FALSE` specifying whether a given row
  of fires should be highlighted. For reference, the function is given at the
  end of the exam.
  
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$dotplot <- renderPlot(dotplot(fires, # ??
  output$histogram <- renderPlot(year_histogram(fires))
  output$table <- renderDataTable( # ??
}
         ```
  
     We were looking for three components,
    
      * (.75 points) Define a `reactiveVal` object specifying whether a fire was selected.
      * (0.5 points) Used the associated reactive value in boht the plot and the `DataTable`.
      * (0.75 points) Correctly defined an `observeEvent` that updates the
      reactive value with the currently brushed fires.
  
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
server <- function(input, output) {
  histogram_query <- reactiveVal(rep(TRUE, nrow(fires)))
  output$dotplot <- renderPlot(dotplot(fires, histogram_query()))
  output$histogram <- renderPlot(year_histogram(fires))
  output$table <- renderDataTable(fires %>% filter(histogram_query()))
  
  observeEvent(
    input$years,
    {
      histogram_query(brushedPoints(fires, input$years, allRows = TRUE)$selected_)
    }
  )
}         
        ```
  
  c. (2 points) Sketch the reactivity graph of your final application. Make sure
  to distinguish input, output, and reactive nodes.
  
### Q7

In this problem, we will use D3's general update pattern to visualize a
two-dimensional random walk. The result is an animation of a square that is
moving in random directions across the screen and which leaves a "trail" of its
20 most recently visited positions. Four screenshots from one run of the program
are given below. The first two panels were taken within the first few timesteps,
which is why they show less than 20 squares.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "keep", out.width = 100}
include_graphics(c("figure/rw1.png", "figure/rw2.png", "figure/rw3.png", "figure/rw4.png"))
```

  You have been given the starter code below. `update_walk_data()` pushes an
  array element specifying the next location of the random walk. It also removes
  any array elements from more than 20 time units in the past. The `x` and `y`
  attributes within each element give the `x` and `y` coordinates of the walk.
  `timepoint` specifies the time step at which the array element was added. The
  definition of `update_walk_data()` is given at the end of this exam for
  reference.
  
```{r, eval = FALSE}
let walk = [{x: 250, y: 250, timepoint: 0}],
  timepoint = 0;

function update() {
  timepoint += 1;
  walk = update_walk_data(walk, timepoint)

  let rw = d3.select("svg")
    .selectAll("rect")
    .data(walk, d => d.timepoint)
}

d3.interval(update, 100)
```

  a. (2 points) How would you modify the `update()` function so that it removes
  all "old" random walk locations that are no longer contained within the `walk`
  array?

     We need to exit the points that are no longer needed. This would be placed at
the end of the `update()` function: `rw.exit().remove().`

  b. (2 points) How would you modify the `update()` function so that, after each
  time step, it appends a rectangle at the newest random walk location?

     We need to enter the newly bound points and set their `x` and `y`
     coordinates. This could go either before or after the exit command defined
     above. One point was given for the correct `enter().append("rect")` syntax.
     Another was given for setting the attributes correctly.
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
rw.enter().append("rect")
  .attrs({
    x: d => d.x,
    y: d => d.y,
    width: 10,
    height: 10
  })
        ```

  c. (2 points) Notice that in the screenshots above, the random walk squares
  become fainter the more time units they are into the past. How would you
  modify the `update()` function to reflect this?

     We need to reselect all the rectangles (even the previously bound ones) and
     change their opacity to reflect their age. This code should go after the
     `enter` code from part (b).

      ```{r, eval = FALSE}
d3.select("svg")
  .selectAll("rect").attrs({
    opacity: d => 1 + 0.05 * (d.timepoint - timepoint)
  })
        ```
