1. [Plant Growth Experiment] This problem will give you practice with tidying a
dataset so that it can be easily visualized. The data describe the height of
several plants measured every 7 days. The plants have been treated with
different amounts of a growth stimulant. The first few rows are printed below --
`height.x` denotes the height of the plant on day `x`.
    
    ```{r}
    plants <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/qg9gwk2ldjdtcmmmiropcunf34ddonya.csv")
    plants
    ```
    
    a. Propose an alternative arrangement of rows and columns that conforms to the
    tidy data principle.
    
```{r}
plants %>%
  pivot_longer(starts_with("height")) %>%
  separate(name, c("tmp", "time"), convert = TRUE) %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_line(aes(time, value, group = plantid)) +
    facet_wrap(~ treatment)
```


```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(name, value, group = plantid)) +
  facet_wrap(~ treatment)
```

    
```{r}
data.frame(
  var = c("height.0-2-1", "height.1-2")
) %>%
  separate(var, c("A", "B", "C"), sep = "-")
```

    
    b. Implement your proposed arrangement from part (a).
    
    c. Using the dataset from (b), design and implement a visualization showing the
    growth of the plants over time according to different treatments.
