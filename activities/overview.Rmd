### Welcome!!

I'm excited to share this course with you this semester. There are few
activities that engage creative, quantitative, and critical thinking skills all
at once, but data visualization is one of them.

Nothing makes my day like a good data visualization, and I look forward to
seeing those that you create.

### Learning Outcomes

In this class, you will learn to...

1. Draw from a **catalog of visual encodings** to support specific visual comparisons in temporal, geospatial, network, hierarchical, high-dimensional count, text, and uncertain data and demonstrate facility implementing them using the R and javascript programming languages.
2.	Draw from a **catalog of interactivity patterns** to compose visualizations that
respond to userâ€™s dynamic queries.
3.	Using the vocabulary of data visualization, **analyze and critique visual designs**.

---

### Learning Outcomes

In this class, you will learn to...

4.	Given a data analysis problem and initial design solution, iteratively **refine visual encodings and interactivity** idioms from across the design space until a satisfactory solution is discovered.
5.	**Navigate the data visualization research literature**, summarize the contributions of a specific methodological proposal, and evaluate their applicability in specific problem contexts.

### Exercise Review

* Let's analyze the exercise results together
* I've uploaded a starter document here: https://tinyurl.com/37vn2ywb
* It also includes the exercise we'll work on together afterwards

### Exercise 1.1

The data below measures properties of various Antarctic penguins.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
penguins <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/ijh7iipc9ect1jf0z8qa2n3j7dgem1gh.csv")
```

Create a single plot that makes it easy to answer both of these questions,
(i) How is bill length related to bill depth within and across species? (ii)
On which islands are which species found?

Read about [Simpson's
paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox) and summarize it
in your own words. Then, explain how part (i) provides a real-world example
of this paradox.

If you finish early -- can you think of an alternative encoding that
visualizes the same information? How do the encodings compare and contrast
with one another?

1. [In-Class Exercise 1.2]

### Exercise Review

This is an exercise in compactly encoding a mix of continuous (bill length and
depth) and nominal (species and island) variables. There are several approaches
possible, and there are trade-offs between them,

  * Color and shape: It's convenient to place all data into the same space, but
  shapes can be hard to read.
  * Color combinations: It's easier to distinguish colors than shapes, but requires
  continually looking up which color is which combination.
  * Faceting: Easier to compare combination, but each panel gets less space.

### Discussion [When2Meet]

* With your neighbors, work through (a - c) of [When2Meet] on the exercise
sheet
* I will ask groups to share brief a summary of their discussions with the rest
of the class
* The question is included on the next slide

---

In addition to being a scheduling tool, When2Meet polls provide a heatmap
visualization of respondent availability. In this exercise, use the results from
our [office hour poll](https://www.when2meet.com/?16334941-sIMyb) to evaluate
the properties of this visualization.

  a. What are two concrete questions that the heatmap visualization is
  effective at answering? Why do you think this?
  
  b. What are two concrete questions that the heatmap visualization is *not* 
  effective at answering? Why do you think this?
  
  c. Describe an alternative static or interactive visual design that is
  better suited to one of the questions you identified in (b).
  
  d. The dataset at [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/main/examples/week1/when2meet_679f22.csv) include responses from our poll. Columns 1 - 35 represent students, and 1/0
  denotes whether the student is or is not available. Implement a version of
  your proposed visual design from (c).

---


### Code Demo [Plant Growth]

* This is a problem in reshaping data to support visualization.

* I've uploaded a starter document here: https://tinyurl.com/5dzsx9ey

---

### Exercise 1.2

20 minutes: In teams of 2 - 5 people, work through [Concept Map] in the exercise
sheet.

10 minutes: Share your concept map with a neighboring team. First, present your
diagram -- you should recap the main points from the course in your own words.
Then, compare and contrast the ways in which your groups organized or
prioritized information.

Note: You will have to form a team on the "People" page on Canvas. Have one
person from your team submit a photo of your concept map and summarize the main
points from your discussion.

---

### Exercise 1.2 [Concept Map]

Prepare a concept map to summarize the last week of reading material. An
effective submission will include a thorough coverage of both abstract concepts
and practical examples, summarized concisely into short phrases. It will also
include well-justified links between nodes, with text explanations for edges
whose interpretation might not be obvious at first.

# September 19, 2022

1. Exercise review
1. Code demo [Improving an App]
1. [In-Class Exercise 2.1]

---

### Announcements

* Project Milestone 0 (Forming Groups) is due on Friday.

---

### Exercise Review

A few common themes emerged across most submissions,

* The distinctions between data, geometry, and encoding in ggplot2
* Descriptions of what make an encoding / visualization effective
  - Clear comparisons, overall readability, orientation around specific tasks
* Description of the different ggplot2 geometry layers
* Examples of faceting and when it can be helpful

---

### Optional: Share your concept map

* I created a Piazza note where you can share your concept map with others in the
class
* Even though the content is similar across submissions, the ways of organizing
information could be quite different
  - If there is a style you like, it can be a nice exercise to try imitating it
  in a future concept map

---

### In-Class Demo [Improving an App]

* This exercise uses reactive expressions to make messy (but still functional)
Shiny apps more readable

* I've uploaded a starter document here: https://tinyurl.com/mw35y9ve

---

### Exercise 2.1

[Olympics Interactive App] 
 
 Hints:
 
   *  For part (a), a `renderPlot()` server element needs to be rerun each time
   the sports `selectInput` has been changed.
   * For part (b), consider how we shared filtered data across server elements
   in the penguin example today.

### September 22

1. Exercise review
1. Code demo [California Wildfires]
1. [In-Class Exercise 2.2]

---

### Announcements

1. For the exercises, know that there is already an Rmarkdown document that
includes all problem descriptions. You don't need to copy and paste code from
PDFs.

---

### Exercise Review

This is an exercise in reactively updating data to feed into interactive
visualizations. The reactive graph has this structure.

### Exercise Review

**Part (a)**: The following server code creates a "selected" column specifying
whether the athlete competes in one of the selected sports.

```{r}
server <- function(input, output) {
  current_data <- reactive({
    olympics %>%
      mutate(selected = Sports %in% input$dropdown)
  })
  
  output$scatterplot <- scatterplot(current_data())
}
```

---

### Exercise Review

**Part (b)**: We can introduce a `dataTableOutput` to print the selected athletes.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  selectInput("dropdown", "Select a Sport", choices = unique(olympics$Sport), multiple = TRUE),
  plotOutput("scatterplot"),
  dataTableOutput("table")
)
    
```

---

### Exercise Review

We can use the same reactive as before to populate the table.

```{r}
server <- function(input, output) {
  updated <- reactive({
    olympics %>%
      mutate(selected = Sport %in% input$dropdown)
  })
  
  output$scatterplot <- renderPlot(scatterplot(updated()))
  output$table <- renderDataTable(
    updated %>% filter(selected)
  )
}
```
