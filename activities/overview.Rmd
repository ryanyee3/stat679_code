### Welcome!!

I'm excited to share this course with you this semester. There are few
activities that engage creative, quantitative, and critical thinking skills all
at once, but data visualization is one of them.

Nothing makes my day like a good data visualization, and I look forward to
seeing those that you create.

### Syllabus

* Teaching team and office hours
* Assessments
* Grading

### Learning Outcomes

In this class, you will learn to...

1. Draw from a **catalog of visual encodings** to support specific visual comparisons in temporal, geospatial, network, hierarchical, high-dimensional count, text, and uncertain data and demonstrate facility implementing them using the R and javascript programming languages.
2.	Draw from a **catalog of interactivity patterns** to compose visualizations that
respond to userâ€™s dynamic queries.
3.	Using the vocabulary of data visualization, **analyze and critique visual designs**.

---

### Learning Outcomes

In this class, you will learn to...

4.	Given a data analysis problem and initial design solution, iteratively **refine visual encodings and interactivity** idioms from across the design space until a satisfactory solution is discovered.
5.	**Navigate the data visualization research literature**, summarize the contributions of a specific methodological proposal, and evaluate their applicability in specific problem contexts.

### Questions?

Also feel free to speak with me after class.

---

### Exercise 0.1

1. Introduce yourself to the people sitting at your table. Your name, program,
and one thing most people don't know about you.

1. Submit a response to [Formulating Questions] in the exercise sheet.

1. Share your chosen datasets in groups of 2 - 3 people.

[Formulating Questions] Pick a dataset from
[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday#datasets), [Data Is
Plural](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0),
[Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [Google Dataset
Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), or your own personal
studies that you would like to visualize this semester. What makes you
interested in this dataset? Please provide a link, so we can use it to create
future exercises.

### Announcements

1. Office hours will be held 2 - 3pm Tuesdays and 11am - 12pm on Fridays. These
sessions will be hybrid -- you can join in person at MSC 7225C or through Zoom.

1. The description for how to form groups is in Project Milestone 0. If you do
not form a team by the deadline, you will be randomly assigned one.

1. Problem set 1 is online.

### Exercise Review

* Let's analyze the exercise results together
* I've uploaded a starter document here: https://tinyurl.com/37vn2ywb
* It also includes the exercise we'll work on together afterwards

---

### Exercise 1.1

The data below measures properties of various Antarctic penguins.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
penguins <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/ijh7iipc9ect1jf0z8qa2n3j7dgem1gh.csv")
```

Create a single plot that makes it easy to answer both of these questions,
(i) How is bill length related to bill depth within and across species? (ii)
On which islands are which species found?

Read about [Simpson's
paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox) and summarize it
in your own words. Then, explain how part (i) provides a real-world example
of this paradox.

If you finish early -- can you think of an alternative encoding that
visualizes the same information? How do the encodings compare and contrast
with one another?

### Exercise Review

This is an exercise in compactly encoding a mix of continuous (bill length and
depth) and nominal (species and island) variables. There are several approaches
possible, and there are trade-offs between them,

  * Color and shape: It's convenient to place all data into the same space, but
  shapes can be hard to read.
  * Color combinations: It's easier to distinguish colors than shapes, but requires
  continually looking up which color is which combination.
  * Faceting: Easier to compare combination, but each panel gets less space.

### Code Demo [Plant Growth]

* This is a problem in reshaping data to support visualization.

### Exercise 1.2

20 minutes: In teams of 2 - 4 people, work through [Concept Map] in the exercise
sheet.

10 minutes: Share your concept map with a neighboring team. First, present your
diagram -- you should recap the main points from the course in your own words.
Then, compare and contrast the ways in which your groups organized or
prioritized information.

Note: You will have to form a team on the "People" page on Canvas. Have one
person from your team submit a photo of your concept map and summarize the main
points from your discussion.

---

### Exercise 1.2 [Concept Map]

Prepare a concept map to summarize the last week of reading material. An
effective submission will include a thorough coverage of both abstract concepts
and practical examples, summarized concisely into short phrases. It will also
include well-justified links between nodes, with text explanations for edges
whose interpretation might not be obvious at first.
