### Learning Outcomes

1.	Draw from a catalog of visual encodings to support specific visual comparisons in temporal, geospatial, network, hierarchical, high-dimensional count, text, and uncertain data and demonstrate facility implementing them using the R and javascript programming languages.
2.	Draw from a catalog of interactivity patterns to compose visualizations that respond to userâ€™s dynamic queries.
3.	Using the vocabulary of data visualization, analyze and critique visual designs.
4.	Given a data analysis problem and initial design solution, iteratively refine visual encodings and interactivity idioms from across the design space until a satisfactory solution is discovered.
5.	Navigate the data visualization research literature, summarize the contributions of a specific methodological proposal, and evaluate their applicability in specific problem contexts.
