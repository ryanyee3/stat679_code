### Welcome!!

I'm excited to share this course with you this semester. There are few
activities that engage creative, quantitative, and critical thinking skills all
at once, but data visualization is one of them.

Nothing makes my day like a good data visualization, and I look forward to
seeing those that you create.

* Assessments
* Grading

---

### Learning Outcomes

In this class, you will learn to...

1. Draw from a **catalog of visual encodings** to support specific visual comparisons in temporal, geospatial, network, hierarchical, high-dimensional count, text, and uncertain data and demonstrate facility implementing them using the R and javascript programming languages.
2.	Draw from a **catalog of interactivity patterns** to compose visualizations that
respond to user’s dynamic queries.
3.	Using the vocabulary of data visualization, **analyze and critique visual designs**.

---

### Learning Outcomes

In this class, you will learn to...

4.	Given a data analysis problem and initial design solution, iteratively **refine visual encodings and interactivity** idioms from across the design space until a satisfactory solution is discovered.
5.	**Navigate the data visualization research literature**, summarize the contributions of a specific methodological proposal, and evaluate their applicability in specific problem contexts.

---

### Exercise 1.1

The data below measures properties of various Antarctic penguins.


```r
penguins &lt;- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/ijh7iipc9ect1jf0z8qa2n3j7dgem1gh.csv")
```

Create a single plot that makes it easy to answer both of these questions,
(i) How is bill length related to bill depth within and across species? (ii)
On which islands are which species found?

Read about [Simpson's
paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox) and summarize it
in your own words. Then, explain how part (i) provides a real-world example
of this paradox.

If you finish early -- can you think of an alternative encoding that
visualizes the same information? How do the encodings compare and contrast
with one another?

1. Exercise review
1. Code demo [Plant growth]
1. (If Time) Discussion [When2meet]
1. [In-Class Exercise 1.2]

---

### Exercise Review

This is an exercise in compactly encoding a mix of continuous (bill length and
depth) and nominal (species and island) variables. There are several approaches
possible, and there are trade-offs between them,

  * Color and shape: It's convenient to place all data into the same space, but
  shapes can be hard to read.
  * Color combinations: It's easier to distinguish colors than shapes, but requires
  continually looking up which color is which combination.
  * Faceting: Easier to compare combination, but each panel gets less space.

### Discussion [When2Meet]

* With your neighbors, work through (a - c) of [When2Meet] on the exercise
sheet
* I will ask groups to share brief a summary of their discussions with the rest
of the class
* The question is included on the next slide

---

In addition to being a scheduling tool, When2Meet polls provide a heatmap
visualization of respondent availability. In this exercise, use the results from
our [office hour poll](https://www.when2meet.com/?16334941-sIMyb) to evaluate
the properties of this visualization.

  a. What are two concrete questions that the heatmap visualization is
  effective at answering? Why do you think this?
  
  b. What are two concrete questions that the heatmap visualization is *not* 
  effective at answering? Why do you think this?
  
  c. Describe an alternative static or interactive visual design that is
  better suited to one of the questions you identified in (b).
  
  d. The dataset at [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/main/examples/week1/when2meet_679f22.csv) include responses from our poll. Columns 1 - 35 represent students, and 1/0
  denotes whether the student is or is not available. Implement a version of
  your proposed visual design from (c).

---


### Code Demo [Plant Growth]

* This is a problem in reshaping data to support visualization.

* I've uploaded a starter document here: https://tinyurl.com/5dzsx9ey

---

### Exercise 1.2

20 minutes: In teams of 2 - 5 people, work through [Concept Map] in the exercise
sheet.

10 minutes: Share your concept map with a neighboring team. First, present your
diagram -- you should recap the main points from the course in your own words.
Then, compare and contrast the ways in which your groups organized or
prioritized information.

Note: You will have to form a team on the "People" page on Canvas. Have one
person from your team submit a photo of your concept map and summarize the main
points from your discussion.

---

### Exercise 1.2 [Concept Map]

Prepare a concept map to summarize the last week of reading material. An
effective submission will include a thorough coverage of both abstract concepts
and practical examples, summarized concisely into short phrases. It will also
include well-justified links between nodes, with text explanations for edges
whose interpretation might not be obvious at first.

---

# September 19, 2022

1. Exercise review
1. Code demo [Improving an App]
1. [In-Class Exercise 2.1]

---

### Announcements

* Project Milestone 0 (Forming Groups) is due on Friday.

---

### Exercise Review

A few common themes emerged across most submissions,

* The distinctions between data, geometry, and encoding in ggplot2
* Descriptions of what make an encoding / visualization effective
  - Clear comparisons, overall readability, orientation around specific tasks
* Description of the different ggplot2 geometry layers
* Examples of faceting and when it can be helpful

---

### Optional: Share your concept map

* I created a Piazza note where you can share your concept map with others in the
class
* Even though the content is similar across submissions, the ways of organizing
information could be quite different
  - If there is a style you like, it can be a nice exercise to try imitating it
  in a future concept map

---

### In-Class Demo [Improving an App]

* This exercise uses reactive expressions to make messy (but still functional)
Shiny apps more readable

* I've uploaded a starter document here: https://tinyurl.com/mw35y9ve

---

### Exercise 2.1

[Olympics Interactive App] 
 
 Hints:
 
   *  For part (a), a `renderPlot()` server element needs to be rerun each time
   the sports `selectInput` has been changed.
   * For part (b), consider how we shared filtered data across server elements
   in the penguin example today.
 
 
---

### September 21, 2022

1. Exercise review
1. Code demo [California Wildfires]
1. [In-Class Exercise 2.2]

---

### Announcements

1. For the exercises, know that there is already an Rmarkdown document that
includes all problem descriptions. You don't need to copy and paste code from
PDFs.

---

### Exercise Review

**Part (a)**: The following server code creates a "selected" column specifying
whether the athlete competes in one of the selected sports.


```r
server &lt;- function(input, output) {
  current_data &lt;- reactive({
    olympics %&gt;%
      mutate(selected = Sports %in% input$dropdown)
  })
  
  output$scatterplot &lt;- scatterplot(current_data())
}
```

---

### Exercise Review

**Part (b)**: We can introduce a `dataTableOutput` to print the selected athletes.


```r
ui &lt;- fluidPage(
  selectInput("dropdown", "Select a Sport", choices = unique(olympics$Sport), multiple = TRUE),
  plotOutput("scatterplot"),
  dataTableOutput("table")
)
```

---

### Exercise Review

We can use the same reactive as before to populate the table.


```r
server &lt;- function(input, output) {
  updated &lt;- reactive({
    olympics %&gt;%
      mutate(selected = Sport %in% input$dropdown)
  })
  
  output$scatterplot &lt;- renderPlot(scatterplot(updated()))
  output$table &lt;- renderDataTable(
    updated %&gt;% filter(selected)
  )
}
```

### In-Class Exercise

In teams of 2 - 4 people, work through [Reactivity Graphs] in the exercise
sheet.

For submission, have one member of your team submit a short video of the
original interactive visualization and a sketch of the reactive graph you
derived from it. Work in the same teams that you used to submit exercise 1.2.

Additionally:  Identify one point of common confusion across your group. Include this in
  your write-up so that we can go over the most common ones during lecture on
  Monday.

---

### September 26, 2022

1. Exercise review
1. Code demo [Wildfires - Part (c)]
1. [In-Class Exercise 3.1]

---

### Announcements

1. Issue with group submission for Exercise 2.2 - we will manage it
1. Problem Set 1 is due on Friday (9/30) at 11:59pm
1. Thank you to the students who helped fix the `quantile` input in the in-class
demo. Their approach is in the In-Class Demo 2.2 link.

---

### Shiny Apps in Problem Sets

If you tried compiling a Shiny app within an rmarkdown document, you probably
saw a message like the one below,

&lt;img src="figures/shiny_rmarkdown.png"/&gt;

You did not make a mistake! Shiny doesn't allow you to host an app within an
Rmarkdown document, unfortunately.

---

### Shiny Apps in Problem Sets

To let us grade your Shiny apps within the problem sets, you have three options,

1. Release the code in a way that allows us to run it (for example, make sure
you don't refer to any file paths on your computer). Upload both your compiled
document and the original `.Rmd` source.

1. Include a screen recording of your app along with the code you used to create
it. If you do this, you do not need to make sure other computers can run your
code -- we will just read it.

1. You could try hosting your app on a public site. UW Madison has an Rstudio
Connect account, which lets you host apps for free. You can sign up
[here](https://it.wisc.edu/news/rstudio-team-pilot/).

---

### Points of Confusion

1. Where do events (e.g., button clicks) go in the reactive graph?
1. What is the difference between a reactive expression and a function?
1. Subtleties between outputs we didn't cover in class -- `eventReactive()` and `observeEvent`

---

### Points of Confusion

Q: Where do events (e.g., button clicks) go in the reactive graph?

These kinds of events actually live "outside" the reactive graph. There is a
chapter about this in the [Mastering Shiny
book](https://mastering-shiny.org/reactivity-components.html). Don't worry if
you created a node for this -- we hadn't covered this in class.

&lt;img src="figures/observe_graph.png"/&gt;

---

### Points of Confusion

Q: Where do events (e.g., button clicks) go in the reactive graph?

Here is an example from the book,


```r
ui &lt;- fluidPage(
  textInput("nm", "name"),
  actionButton("clr", "Clear"),
  textOutput("hi")
)
server &lt;- function(input, output) {
  hi &lt;- reactive(paste0("Hi ", input$nm))
  output$hi &lt;- renderText(hi())
  observeEvent(input$clr, {
    updateTextInput(inputId = "nm", value = "")
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

---

### Points of Confusion

Q: Where do events (e.g., button clicks) go in the reactive graph?

&lt;img src="figures/invalidate-1.png"/&gt;


---

### Points of Confusion  

Q: What is the difference between a reactive expression and a function?

1. A reactive expression is like a function that can depend on `input` elements,
and which reruns each time an input is changed
1. Using a function within a server, but outside of a `render` or `reactive`
context, will fail



```r
f &lt;- function(x) {
  x ^ 2
}

## DOES NOT WORK
server &lt;- function(input, output) {
  f(input$x)
  ...
}
```

---

### Points of Confusion

Q: Subtleties between outputs we didn't cover in class -- `eventReactive()` and
`observeEvent()`

An observer does not store any value. An `eventReactive()` can store an
intermediate value that appears in a later `render*` expression.

---


### In-Class Demo

* This exercise uses extends our earlier wildfires app to use graphical inputs

* I've uploaded a starter document here: https://tinyurl.com/nhb6kt46

---

### In-Class Demo

Right now, the dotplot responds to the brushed histogram. However,

  * The dotplot does not allow any user inputs.
  * The histogram does not reflect year or user selections.

Imagine someone came to your statistical consulting hours with this application.
They want your expertise to improve the app so that it conveys more information.
How would you approach this? What might be some first steps towards
implementation?

Take 7 minutes to discuss with a neighbor, then we will regroup and share.

---

### In-Class Exercise

[Birds Brushed Scatterplot] - Only part (a)

Hint: This problem is similar to the example in Week 3 - 2: Brush Inputs.

---

### September 28, 2022

1. Exercise review
1. Project Strategies + Q&amp;A
1. [In-Class Exercise 3.2]

---

### Announcements

1. This Friday's Office Hours rescheduled to 2 - 3pm (not 11am - 12pm).
1. We will be moving on to Module 2 (Visualization with D3) starting
next week. If you have questions about ggplot2 or shiny visualization, it is
best to reach out soon.

---

### Exercise Review

This is an exercise in using `reactiveVal` and `observeEvent` to support a brush
query within Shiny.


```r
library(shiny)
ui &lt;- fluidPage(
  fluidRow(
    column(6, plotOutput("plot", brush = "plot_brush")),
    column(4, dataTableOutput("table"))
  )
)
```

---

### Exercise Review

The server uses a `reactiveVal` + `observeEvent` pattern.


```r
server &lt;- function(input, output) {
  selected &lt;- reactiveVal(rep(TRUE, nrow(birds)))
  observeEvent(
    input$plot_brush,
    selected(brushedPoints(birds, input$plot_brush, allRows = TRUE)$selected_)
  )

  output$plot &lt;- renderPlot(scatter(birds, selected()))
  output$table &lt;- renderDataTable(
    filtered_table(birds, selected()),
    options = list(pageLength = 5)
  )
}
```

---

### Exercise Review

These functions update the table and scatterplot based on the selection.


```r
scatter &lt;- function(x, selected_) {
  x %&gt;%
    mutate(selected_ = factor(selected_, levels = c("FALSE", "TRUE"))) %&gt;%
    ggplot() +
    geom_point(aes(Ellipticity, Asymmetry, col = selected_)) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("black", "red")) +
    theme(legend.position = "none")
}

filtered_table &lt;- function(birds, selected_) {
  birds %&gt;% 
    select(Order, Family, MVZDatabase) %&gt;% 
    filter(selected_)
}
```

---

### Project Reflections

1. How should you approach your course project?
1. Hopefully, these reflections will be useful for your future projects too
1. Please ask questions, this will work better as a discussion

---

### Conceptualization: Storytelling

The most compelling projects are structured like stories.

Opening: What is the setting? Who are the main characters?

Conflict: How is the state of the world unsatisfactory?

Action: How was the conflict resolved?

Resolution: What have we learned more generally?

---

### Conceptualization: Community

1. In the area that you choose to study, who are your intellectual peers?
1. A common problem in data science projects are that they become too abstract /
have no clear intended audience.
1. The project should be interesting because of what it says about real world
phenomena which are interseting within your community -- don't talk about data
without context.

---

### Conceptualization: Synthesis

1. No problems are solved in a vacuum. What ideas are you building from?
1. The most creative projects draw from sources that were not obviously
relevant, but which later turn out to be.

---

### Implementation: Reading

1. For both community and synthesis, it is very helpful to read extensively
1. This helps you understand the standards of the community (or communities) you
are working in.
1. It also provides source material for problem solving.
1. Today's in-class exercise provides more concrete suggestions for how to go
about identifying reading material

---

### Implementation: Prototyping

1. It is much better to explore a variety of designs before committing to one
specific approach.
1. This is one of the reasons why having a well-defined problem is important --
it creates a center around which many approaches can be explored

.center[
&lt;img src="figures/design-space.png" width=800/&gt;
]

---

### Implementation: Feedback

1. Some of the most important data you can get during a project is feedback from
your peers
1. Their responses may reveal unwarranted assumptions you have made or point you
towards a previously unnoticed path forward

---

### Reflection and Questions

With your project group, take 5 minutes to brainstorm a list of conceptual or
logistical questions you have related to the project. We will discuss these as a
group.

---

### Exercise 3.2

With your project team, work through [Guided Literature Search] in the exercises
sheet.

---

### October 3, 2022

1. Intro to D3 / Workflow Setup
1. In-Class Demo 4.1

### Introduction to D3

1. D3 is a visualization library written in javascript.
1. It operates at a much lower level than R / ggplot2. This both makes it much
more flexible, but also requires more effort to work with.
1. Unlike Shiny, it can modify visualizations in place, since it doesn't depend
on transitions between static image views.

---

### Workflow Setup

1. To build D3 visualizations, we will mainly be editing `.html`, `.css`, and
`.js` files. This can be done in Rstudio, but other text editors work as well
(e.g., VSCode, Atom, Emacs, ...).
1. You will not need it this week, but starting next week, you will need to have
a python installation on your computer. This will be used to start a server
needed for loading data.
1. It's possible to incorporate D3 visualizations into Rmarkdown reports and
Shiny Apps. It is a somewhat more advanced topic, though, so reach out if you
would like to try this.

---

### Workflow Setup

Let's test our setup by editing a simple [HTML
file](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/raw/main/examples/week4/week4-1/example_headings.html).
Work with your neighbors in case you have any difficulty.


```html
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;This is a Header&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This text is in a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```

---

### Workflow Setup

1. Let's make sure you can add a `.js` file to do some computation in the
background.
1. You'll also want to be able to use your browser's developer tools. 

.pull-left[
`example_headings.html`

```html

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;This is a Header&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This text is in a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;script src="example.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```
]

.pull-right[
`example.js`

```js
let x = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(x);
```


&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
let x = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(x);
&lt;/script&gt;

### Exercise Review

For each of `penguins` and `penguins2`, describe whether the data structure is
(i) an object of arrays, (ii) an array of objects, or (iii) neither. In case
(iii), specify the structure.

* `penguins` is an array of objects. Each object corresponds to one row
(sample), and the array gives the full dataset.


```r
let penguins = [{"species":"Adelie","island":"Torgersen",...},{"species":"Adelie","island":"Torgersen",...}, ...]
```

---

### Exercise Review

For each of `penguins` and `penguins2`, describe whether the data structure is
(i) an object of arrays, (ii) an array of objects, or (iii) neither. In case
(iii), specify the structure.

* `penguins2` is an object of arrays. Each key of the object corresponds to one
column, and the associated array gives all penguins' measurements for that
column.


```r
let penguins2 = {"species":["Adelie","Adelie",...],"island":["Torgersen","Torgersen",...],...}
```


---

### Exercise Review

Using `penguins2`, compute the mean flipper length.

For this part, we need to (i) extract the array within the object containing flipper length, and (ii) compute its mean.


```r
d3.mean(penguins2["flipper_length_mm"])
```

---

### Exercise Review

Using `penguins`, define a new array whose elements are `true` or `false`
depending on whether flipper length is larger than 187.

We can accomplish this using a for loop.


```r
let result = [];
for (let i = 0; i &lt; penguins.length; i++) {
  result.push(penguins[i].flipper_length_mm &gt; 187)
}
```

---

### Exercise Review

Using `penguins`, define a new array whose elements are `true` or `false`
depending on whether flipper length is larger than 187.

An even more concise solution uses `map`.


```r
result = penguins.map(d =&gt; d.flipper_length_mm &gt; 187)
```

---

### Exercise Review

* This is how the solution looks like in a single javascript file
* For in-class exercises like this, it is enough to submit your HTML, CSS, and
JS files. Any discussion can go in JS comments or HTML paragraphs.

### Exercise Review 

Goal: I want to try to get the average of the “temp_max” array in
“forecast” below.

Attempt: Here is my [HTML](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/blob/main/activities/week4/in_class4-2a.html) and [JS](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/blob/main/activities/week4/in_class4-2a.js) file. This is the part that I think is
relevant,

```r
let forecast = {temp_max: [22, 24, 28, 21], temp_min: [15, 14, 21, 24]}
d3.mean(forecast[0])
```
Problem: The console prints the error message,
```
 Uncaught TypeError: t is not iterable at t.mean (d3-array@3:2:13861) at in_class4-2a.js:3:4 
```

---

### Exercise Review (part a, not required)

Solution: To index into objects, we need to use a key.


```r
d3.mean(forecast["temp_max"])
```

---

### Exercise Review (part b)

b. Goal: I want to change the color of all the circles on my [HTML page](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/blob/main/activities/week4/in_class4-2b.html) to blue. 

Attempt:
Here is my [HTML](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/blob/main/activities/week4/in_class4-2b.html) and [JS](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/blob/main/activities/week4/in_class4-2b.js) file. This is the part that I think is relevant,

```r
d3.select("circle")
  .attr("fill", "blue")
```
Problem: Only the color of the one circle [is changing](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/blob/main/exercises/figure/d3_bugs.png).

---

### Exercise Review (part b)

Solution: If there are multiple matches, `d3.select` will only select the first
element. We need to use `d3.selectAll`.


```r
d3.selectAll("circle")
  .attr("fill", "blue")
```

---

### Exercise Review (part c)

Goal: I want to change the color of all the class “highlighted” squares.

Attempt: Here is my [HTML](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/blob/main/activities/week4/in_class4-2c.html) and [JS](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/blob/main/activities/week4/in_class4-2c.js) file. This is the part that I think is relevant,

```r
d3.selectAll("highlighted")
  .attr("fill", "red")
```
Problem: Nothing is changing.

---

### Exercise Review (part c)

Solution: Class selectors need to be preceded by a period. The code below would
work,


```r
d3.selectAll(".highlighted")
  .attr("fill", "red")
```

---

### Exercise Review (part d)

Goal: I want to move the circle to location 100, 200 on the SVG canvas.
    
Attempt: Here is my [HTML](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/blob/main/activities/week4/in_class4-2d.html) and [JS](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/blob/main/activities/week4/in_class4-2d.js) file. This is the part that I think is relevant,

```r
d3.select("#my_circle")
  .attrs({ x: 100, y: 200 })
```
Problem: It is not moving.

---

### Exercise Review (part d)

Solution: The position of SVG circles is set by attributes called `cx` and `cy`, not `x`
and `y`.


```r
d3.select("#my_circle")
  .attrs({ cx: 100, cy: 200 })
```

notes.

---

### Exercise Review

* You only had to write pseudocode for this exercise
* Most hypothetical examples had an emphasis on animation or interactivity, both
of which are appropriate use cases for the general update pattern
* Common points of confusion,
  - Subtleties with interactivity and transitions
  - Behavior of HTML enters / exits
  - Application to real (not just simulated) data
  
---
  
### Exercise Review

Subtleties with interactivity and transitions,
  
* The button `update()` was in the HTML, not the JS file.
    - We could have alternatively included the update within the JS code by
    adding an event listener
    - See this implementation [[1](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/blob/main/activities/week5/demo5-1-jschange.html), [2](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/blob/main/activities/week5/demo5-1-jschange.js)]
* The notes for Week 6-1 are dedicated to interactivity
    

```r
d3.select("body")
  .select("#my_button")
  .on("mousedown", update)
```

---

### Exercise Review
    
Subtleties with interactivity and transitions,

* How can we use multiple transitions simultaneously?

### Exercise Review

Data Structure vs. HTML Changes

1. D3 stands for "Data-Driven Documents." The general update pattern is a way to
have HTML tags reflect changes in underlying data structures.
1. When we bind a data array and append new HTML elements, we are associating
each element with a data item.
1. D3 uses either array index or ID functions to make that association.
1. Objects in new data binds can be compared with existing HTML-data
associations

---

### Exercise Review

This all seems fine for made up data, but how will we manage all this on real
datasets?

1. Next week's notes introduce visualizations with real datasets.
1. Real applications are generally going to be based on,
  - Filtering arrays that are no longer of interest
  - Checking whether an object's attributes make it worth highlighting
  - Changing the attributes that are used to define the encoding
  which I think you will find similar to what we have seen with toy data.
1. Right now we are still in the foundations. We'll use D3 on real data
throughout the second half of the course.

* `gapminder-update2.js`
* `zoom.js`

---

### Exercise Review - `rain.js`

&lt;iframe src="https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat679_code/examples/week5/week5-2/rain.html" width=800 height=200/&gt;
]

---


### Exercise Review - `rain.js`

What is the `map` doing?

It multiplies the radius of each existing circle by `d.rate`.


```r
function update_data(rain) {
      rain = rain.concat(new_point(900, 200, 50))
      rain = rain.map(d =&gt; { d.r *= d.rate; return d})
```

---

### Exercise Review - `rain.js`

What is the `map` doing?

This is an equivalent way to write the map.


```r
function update_data(rain) {
      rain = rain.concat(new_point(900, 200, 50))
      
      for (let i = 0; i &lt; rain.length; i++ ) {
        rain[i].r = rain[i].r * rain[i].rate
      }
```

---

### Exercise Review - `gapminder-update2.js`

.center[
&lt;iframe src="https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat679_code/examples/week5/week5-4/gapminder-update2.html" height=500, width=900/&gt;
]

---

### Exercise Review - `gapminder-update2.js`

What is `ev`?


```r
function update_continents(ev, data, scales) {
  continents = $(ev.target).val()
  let subset = data.filter(d =&gt; continents.indexOf(d.continent) != -1 &amp; d.year == year);
  ...
```

---

### Exercise Review - `gapminder-update2.js`

`ev` is a variable representing the input click event


```r
function setup_inputs(data, scales) {
  d3.select("#country_select")
  .on("change", (ev) =&gt; update_continents(ev, data, scales))
  ...  

function update_continents(ev, data, scales) {
  continents = $(ev.target).val()
  let subset = data.filter(d =&gt; continents.indexOf(d.continent) != -1 &amp; d.year == year);
  ...
```

---

### Exercise Review - `gapminder-update2.js`

* `ev.target` specifies the HTML tag associated with the selection menu
* `$(ev.target).val()` returns an array of the currently selected continents


```r
function setup_inputs(data, scales) {
  d3.select("#country_select")
  .on("change", (ev) =&gt; update_continents(ev, data, scales))
  ...  
  
function update_continents(ev, data, scales) {
  continents = $(ev.target).val()
  let subset = data.filter(d =&gt; continents.indexOf(d.continent) != -1 &amp; d.year == year);
  ...  
```

---

### Exercise Review - `gapminder-update2.js`

What does this first line do?

* For a slider input, `ev.target.value` returns the current value for the slider
* By default it is a string. `+ev.target.value` converts it to a numerical variable


```r
function update_year(ev, data, scales) {
  year = +ev.target.value
  ...
```

---

### Exercise Review - `gapminder-update2.js`

Why does a version of this code appear in both the initialization and update
functions?

* We need to re-append circles on every update
* If we only had it in initialize, new countries could never get added in
* If we only had it in update, the scatterplot would be empty until one of the
inputs is changed


```r
let selection = d3.select("svg").selectAll("circle")
  .data(subset, d =&gt; d.country)
selection.enter()
  .append("circle")
  .attrs({
    cx: d =&gt; scales.x(d.lpop),
    cy: d =&gt; scales.y(d.life_expectancy),
    fill: d =&gt; scales.fill(d.continent),
  })
```

---

### Exercise Review - `zoom.js`

.center[
&lt;iframe src="https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat679_code/examples/week6/week6-4/zoom.html" width=800 height=500/&gt;
]

---

### Exercise Review - `zoom.js`

How exactly does the setup function work?


```r
function setup_brushes(data, scales) {
  let brush = d3.brush()
    .extent([[width - 100, 0], [width, 100]])
    .on("brush", ev =&gt; brush_update(ev, scales));

  d3.select("#context")
    .append("g")
    .attr("class", "brush")
    .call(brush)
}
```

---

### Exercise Review - `zoom.js`

* This creates a brush object, but limited to the top right corner
* It also says to run the `brush_update` function every time the brush is moved


```r
let brush = d3.brush()
  .extent([[width - 100, 0], [width, 100]])
  .on("brush", ev =&gt; brush_update(ev, scales));
```

---

### Exercise Review - `zoom.js`

* This "calls" the brush object onto an empty `&lt;g id="context"&gt;` element
* When the call occurs, many small HTML tags are automatically appended (it's
the same mechanism used for axes)


```r
d3.select("#context")
  .append("g")
  .attr("class", "brush")
  .call(brush)
```

---

### Exercise Review - `zoom.js`

The update function wasn't clear.


```r
function brush_update(ev, scales) {
  let [[x0, y0], [x1, y1]] = ev.selection;
  x0 = scales.x_zoom.invert(x0)
  y0 = scales.y_zoom.invert(y0)
  x1 = scales.x_zoom.invert(x1)
  y1 = scales.y_zoom.invert(y1)

  let new_scale = make_scales([[x0, y0], [x1, y1]])
  update(new_scale)
}
```

---

### Exercise Review - `zoom.js`


```r
// Gets brush coordinates in pixel coordinates
let [[x0, y0], [x1, y1]] = ev.selection; 

// Gets brush coordinates in original data coordinates
x0 = scales.x_zoom.invert(x0)
y0 = scales.y_zoom.invert(y0)
x1 = scales.x_zoom.invert(x1)
y1 = scales.y_zoom.invert(y1)
```

* [This link](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)
describes how to create a public webpage starting from an empty GitHub
repository.
* The key steps are on the "Pages" menu on the repository's settings tab

### GitHub Pages

* If you already have a github repository, try [forking this repository](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat679_test)
* Follow along to make an HTML page public

---

### Jekyll

* There are many sites that offer website templates (many more than I can review)
  - E.g., search for "Free Bootstrap Templates"
  - The directions will vary from service to service, but at some point they
  provide HTML pages that you can edit
* My favorite approach uses Jekyll (this is how the course notes page was created)

---

### Jekyll Workflow

* You have to install the [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) command line program
* Create a new site using `jekyll new test`
* Add a theme by modifying the `Gemfile` and `_config.yml`. For example, to add the simplex theme, use
  - (Gemfile) Replace `gem "minima"` with `gem "jekyll-theme-persephone"`
  - (Config) `theme: minima` with `theme: jekyll-theme-persephone`
* Setup the page with `bundle install`
* Run the site with `bundle exec jekyll serve`
* Many example themes available on the [jekyll themes website](http://jekyllthemes.org/)

### R2D3

* R2D3 is an R package that lets you wrap D3 code within Rmarkdown documents and
Shiny apps
* See [the r2d3-countries](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/tree/main/activities/week7)
example for how to reproduce last week's demo within an Rmarkdown notebook
* We can also pass in data from R into D3. See the [r2d3-data example](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/tree/main/activities/week7)

---

### Observable

Finally, you can share D3-based notebooks using the Observable.

* Advantage: Don't have to host pages yourself
* Disadvantage: Dependencies between notebook cells require extra care

### In-Class Demo

* Let's work through [NYC Trees]

* I've uploaded a starter document here: https://tinyurl.com/yc3ynkn3

### In-Class Exercise

Work through [Job Interview] in the exercises sheet, with the topic of static
spatial or temporal data visualization. Upload your response to Canvas and also
add it to this [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b4TqaulxL8Bz0Me3lGkXheJmg9nqhUhcp-dNywthMhM/edit?usp=sharing).


[Job Interview] Imagine that you are interviewing job candidates for a data
science position that involves visualizing Temporal or Geospatial data. Prepare
an interview question that test candidates' knowledge of / experience with these
topics. Also prepare examples of strong responses. An good question will either
(i) ask the interviewee to describe a specific time in the past where they used
the concept or (ii) present the interviewee with a type of challenge related to
what is commonly encountered and see how they would address it.
