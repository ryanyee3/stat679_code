a. Define a tidymodels `recipe` that specifies that UMAP should be performed
with the parameters `learn_rate = 0.1` and `neighbors = 5`. There is no need to
normalize these data, as they have been normalized in advance using methods
tailored to single-cell genomics data.

```{r}
umap_rec <- recipe(~ ., data = pbmc) %>%
  update_role(cell_tag, new_role = "id") %>%
  step_umap(all_predictors(), neighbors = 5, min_dist = 0.1)

embeddings <- umap_rec %>%
  prep() %>%
  juice()

embeddings %>%
  left_join(pbmc) %>%
  write_csv("scores.csv")
```
