*Static temporal data visualization in D3*

1.  These notes give the D3 analogs of some of the visualizations
    created in our earlier notes on temporal visualization. For a pure
    static visualization, these methods are not necessary — the R
    approach can give satisfactory results more easily. However, if we
    ever want to customize the appearance or interactivity beyond what
    is possible in the R packages we discussed, then these examples can
    serve as a starting point.

2.  Let’s begin with the basic line plot. We had given an example in
    these notes, but we swept important details about d3’s path
    generators under the rug.

3.  Remember that in these notes, we had manually generated paths using
    strings like`M 20 20 L 5 5 L 10 10`. This means to start a path at
    pixel coordinates (20, 20), move to the right and down by 5 units,
    and then move in the same directions again by 10 units.

4.  To map data to these types of coordinates, we can use an SVG path
    generator. This is a function that converts an array of javascript
    objects to SVG path strings like the one above. This is accomplished
    by using `d3.line()` and supplying functions that give the `x` and
    `y` pixel coordinates given a single object from the array. The `x`
    and `y` functions are usually light wrappers of scales that map the
    raw data into pixel coordinates.

5.  For example, to regenerate the lynx plot, we can use the code below.

6.  If we want to draw a collection of paths, we can use an array of
    arrays. Each element of the outer collection provides a path; each
    element within the inner arrays gives one timepoint. For example,
    the code below generates the electricity visualization from before.

7.  At this point, it’s not hard to add in tooltips using mouseovers.

8.  Path generators are just one example of a d3 function that maps raw
    data to more complex visual marks. For example, to create a stacked
    time series visualization, we can use `d3.stackArea()`

9.  Using an alternative centering, the same area generator can be used
    to create a d3 streamgraph.

10. Just to show how flexible d3 can be, let’s see how we can create two
    other types of temporal visualizations from scratch: gantt charts
    and bump charts.

11. Gantt charts encode the start and end of discrete temporal events.
    They are often used to organize projects. They can be generated by
    appending rectangles at the right task (y) and time (x) coordinates.

12. Bump charts are line plots that show how ranks evolve over time. We
    can create the smooth arcing lines using `.curve(d3.curveBumpX)`.

13. We can customize the color depending on whether the rank has
    increased or decreased by storing the change in the data and
    encoding this using each path’s stroke attribute.

14. You can see a full interactive version of this visualization at this
    link — we’ll be discussing this in our next lecture. Notice the use
    of the voronoi mouseover, like the one used in our previous notes.
    We’ll discuss some more techniques for temporal interaction in the
    next set of notes.
